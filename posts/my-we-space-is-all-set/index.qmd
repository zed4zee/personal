I am all set with creating my [personal web space](https://zed4zee.github.io/personal/posts/welcome/) for documenting important areas of my life. 

Categorizing things was a great strategy. It helped me inspect every area closely. 

I created new pages for coding and Linux. 

Things to do later:

- Examine the YAML files and metadata (need to keep it coherent)
- Separate the listings on homepage and add a title for each category
