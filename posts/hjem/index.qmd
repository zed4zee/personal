**Translated Lyrics:**

> *"Nothing happens without a reason"
Someone told me once
back when I was young.
I have tried everything
and every time I fell
I got back on my feet
and I can show you scars
on my body and on my mind
I have tried everything
I have tried everything.*
>
> *Like a verse that found its song
I'm standing here
and though the road—it has been long
I have come home
I have come home*
>
> *Nothing tempts me to go back
out of this moment, this hour, this day,
'cause I have landed here.
And I am exactly where I need to be—about to find out
what kind of person I am.
I am not afraid of failing any more
If you live, that's just what happens.*
>
> *Like a verse that found its song
I'm standing here
and though the road—it has been long
I have come home.*
